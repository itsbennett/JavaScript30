    <p>Took the plunge and decided to start learning some JavaScript because I've been devling into web development as of late anyway, so may as well give it a go. I follow this video blind and had no clue what the hell is going on. In fact, I haven't even gotten it to work properly when following step by step, but I'm going to go back through it and see what's going on and why it isn't working out right, as well as check out the definitions of the different things it had me do.</p>
